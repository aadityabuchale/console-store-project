Hello..!
    Here,I made a console Based Store Application as a part of my Java Training.In this People can Buy Things which are listed there.
    This store project can be used in stores for ease of customer handling and speed of work.
    I have attached some photos of the interaction with the user.

# Exception
 If the user enters wrong number or any non-numeric value then I have handled InputMisMatchException and
 it also includes sleep() method of Thread class which gives time to read the message.
